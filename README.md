ğŸ”¹ğŸ”¸The Ping Pong game is one of the most iconic video games ever created.ğŸ”¹ğŸ”¸

ğŸ”¸It simulates a simple tennis-like game where two players use paddles to bounce a ball back and forth.
ğŸ”¸This project aims to implement a basic Pong game in assembly language, designed to run on a DOS-like environment using direct memory manipulation, video output to the 
  screen, and keyboard input. 
ğŸ”¸The game involves player-controlled paddles that interact with a ball, scoring points as the ball passes the opponentâ€™s paddle.
ğŸ”¸This assembly-based Pong game offers a unique learning experience on low-level programming, hardware interaction, and the intricacies of video memory manipulation, as well ğŸ”¸as providing an engaging gameplay experience.
